This jean was originally released as the 501®Z, and represents the expansion into a new territory.
In the mid-1950's, Levi’s® started selling its trademark 501® jeans on the East Coast. Up to this point, Western states had been the primary sales region since the brands birth in 1873. East Coasters, however, were largely unfamiliar with the button fly work pant. To make it more approachable for new wearers, they took the original 501® and replaced the classic button fly with a zipper, and named it the 501®Z.
It retained all the other details loved by longtime wearers: the famed silhouette, rivets, and the double needle arcuates.
• Zipper fly
• Classic five-pocket styling
• Two large back pockets with concealed rivets
• Two-horse leather (bovine) patch®
• 100% cotton rinse
• Non-stretch 14oz plain selvedge denim made in ‘Cone Mills’
• MADE IN USA

This jean was originally released as the 501®Z, and represents the expansion into a new territory.
In the mid-1950's, Levi’s® started selling its trademark 501® jeans on the East Coast. Up to this point, Western states had been the primary sales region since the brands birth in 1873. East Coasters, however, were largely unfamiliar with the button fly work pant. To make it more approachable for new wearers, they took the original 501® and replaced the classic button fly with a zipper, and named it the 501®Z.
It retained all the other details loved by longtime wearers: the famed silhouette, rivets, and the double needle arcuates.
• Zipper fly
• Classic five-pocket styling
• Two large back pockets with concealed rivets
• Two-horse leather (bovine) patch®
• 100% cotton rinse
• Non-stretch 14oz plain selvedge denim made in ‘Cone Mills’
• Sewn in Europe

jawn_stars,59,Military x Streetwear,5,1255,Vintage Menswear,Vintage Outerwear,Vintage Light Jackets,"This jacket has light signs of fading and wear as well as a few small marks but no major flaws. Sailors used to look forward to docking in Hong Kong where they would take these jackets to various tailors and have the decorative stitching added that you see inside of this one. After they got their jacket back from the tailor, they would then wear them inside out when they went out out the town at night to essentially flex on the other sailors. There is some minor distressed on the sleeve from where the previous owner's rank patch was removed; the person I bought this from said sailors returning from the Korean War would remove these as a way of protesting the war.

Used Condition. See photos for details. Dirt and general wear as this jacket is over 35 years old. The nylon lining has faded from wear
Absolutely insane piece, photos don’t do it justice.
This jacket was issued by the German Navy throughout the early 1960s until 2000 and was used for protection against the elements. Features a cropped fit just above the waist with corset detailing on the sides of the jacket for ventilation along with extended curved sleeves and a nylon lining
This jacket in particular was made by Beckumer Lederwerk and issued sometime in 1986

When the military stopped produce the classic Bunny Boot, the Sorel Kaufman took itself place as the prefered cold weather boot of the north.
These are early 90s ish maybe late 80s
These are deadstock vintage meaning they are old but have not been properly worn. The inside still have the tags on. I laced these up myself. There is still wear from 30+ in storage - take a good look at the pictures
The lining is removable. The lining makes these good for extreme cold weather.
Look at the traction on the bottom, its got lil rubber nipples for snow traction
Made in Canada. Amazing dark green upper, rubber base
Very heavy thus the shipping price
Tagged size 8 but def fit bigger
I wear a size 10-10.5 in US mens and I could wear these semi uncomfortably with liner in. Ideal for a size 9-9.5. Without the liner, I can fully wear these.

now these are nice! a pretty rare pant in a pretty rare size. everyone already knows how nicely these fit, and that they’re the staple straight / semi wide leg fitting pair of pants. in great condition besides some unnoticeable staining on the back and holes in the pockets which are both pictured, but i’m sure the pockets can be sewn back up quick and easy and then the pockets will be perfect, i’d say 7/10 condition. perfect for the upcoming season!

These were used in the 80s by soldiers fighting in Extreme Cold weather Conditions, these Come with a Wool liner and 2 insoles if you live in hot climates I would recommend purchasing these without large wool Liner, if you choose to purchase these without wool liner these fit about 5 times bigger!, so for instance if you’re a size 9.5-10 you are a 5 in these without inserts in.
If you Choose to purchase these with the inserts they will fit true to size, but you don’t have the option to wear these without inserts in!
These boots are super dope and unique and will complement any Fit! I believe the aging on boot makes these even more unique, Some pairs will also have a real soldiers name written inside !

German Army Bundeswehr U-Boat Submarine vintage leather jacket (1970s)
Condition: 8/10
VERY RARE
For its age, the jacket is in very good condition. The inner lining has big stains. The heavy duty zippers work, but are a bit stiff.
This type of leather jacket was not only used by submarine personel of the Bundesmarine (German Navy), it was also used on other naval ships throughout the early 60s until 2000 (as far as my research goes). With a cropped length, wide body, curved sleeves (for better mobility) and a big collar, this jacket was the perfect jacket for protection against the elements for the german navy. This jacket was part of a set (called ""Päckchen"" by the Bundeswehr) consisting of this jacket and a very high waisted pair of leather pants (if you want one of those, feel free to ask).
Throughout the years, this set was manufactured by at least 6 manufacturers: Brauch & Frey Bad Wimpfen, STRIWA, BEWAG, Beckumer Lederwerk, Paul Schulze Brakel and Modeka (Modeka is still in business).
This one is made by Brauch & Frey Bad Wimpfen, manufactured in October 1962.
The jacket has a nylon/viscose lining, which is not sewn to the leather. This gap and the holes on the armpits give the jacket very good ventilation. Zippers are very sturdy and work flawlessly, the big collar can be folded up for additional protection and the extensive lacing system can be used to protect you against wind (very useful on the open sea).",Vintage 1960s German Military U-Boat Submarine Navy Jacket,7,Men's / US M / EU 48-50 / 2,Grey,Used,4

Measurements:
• Length: Back 56cm
• Sleeves: outside 71cm, inside 49cm
• armpit to armpit 56cm
Very soft and thick cow nappa leather, heavy duty Opti zippers on the arms and front . The jacket has a nylon lining with a grey shine to it which is not sewn to the leather. This gap and the holes on the armpits give the jacket very good ventilation.
Condition: NEW !! Comes with original manufacturing card
This type of leather jacket was not only used by submarine personel of the Bundesmarine (German Navy), it was also used on other naval ships throughout the early 60s until 2000 (as far as my research goes). With a cropped length, wide body, curved sleeves (for better mobility) and a big collar, this jacket was the perfect jacket for protection against the elements for the german navy. This jacket was part of a set (called ""Päckchen"" by the Bundeswehr) consisting of this jacket and a very high waisted pair of leather pants.
This particular model was manufactured by Beckumer Lederwerke in july 1970.

Our British Army Pant is based on the 1940’s Battle Dress Pants from the British Army, combining some details from the 1960’s Battle Dress Pants worn by the Rhodesian Security Force.
Through extensive efforts of recreating the 100-year-old cotton twill, our vintage twill fabric is an enhanced version – replicating most characteristics of the original. A delicate balance between spinning, weaving, and dying the fabric was achieved to create the feel and look of the vintage fabric. With a relaxed, tapered fit, these trousers have been crafted to be hardwearing, yet soft and comfortable.

These were used in the 80s by soldiers fighting in Extreme Cold weather Conditions, these Come with a Wool liner and 2 insoles if you live in hot climates I would recommend purchasing these without large wool Liner, if you choose to purchase these without wool liner these fit about 5 times bigger!, so for instance if you’re a size 9.5-10 you are a 5 in these without inserts in.
If you Choose to purchase these with the inserts they will fit true to size, but you don’t have the option to wear these without inserts in!
These boots are super dope and unique and will complement any Fit! I believe the aging on boot makes these even more unique, Some pairs will also have a real soldiers name written inside !

Produced in 2002, Caroline Vlieger and Hein Vandam repurposed used handbags and heat-pressed designs on the uppers to create an invoking design. In the subject of risk and violence, the piece is presented in New York's Museum of Modern Arts as a ""Design Take on Risk."" Originally a response to an overblown media sensationalism regarding the violence in Rotterdam, Netherlands; the duo's neighborhood. Now the Guardian Angel handbag is an ironic piece of protection with an empowering motif for a neo-feminist movement. Styled by Rihanna among others, the embossed detailing often features different types of weapons, satirizing violence out of its actual figures. Signaling that the mere presence itself or even just an image of a tool for violence is enough to trigger a response. Perhaps the Guardian Angel bag protects those who own it, or it integrates the very real bias of violence towards women and its undermining.
The bag features a heat pressed Glock silhouette on a full cowhide leather. The zippers are made of YKK and the bag can be worn like a shoulder bag. With removable straps, and red accent detailing in the interior. This is part of the revamped 2010 release thus the full leather construction.

Designer Notes - ""The ranger 'flared leather pants' are constructed from high quality vegan pu leather, and features a comfortable polyester lining for inside support. the inside lining is added to combat the wear and tear from continuous use, with the sole intent of increasing the pants' longevity. the pants feature a metal button with our custom design, and a small but convenient pocket on the front side. Perfect flow throughout the legs, intending to create a noticeable flare while still having a baggy cut around the thighs and knees.""

🛑 Please pay attention to the indicated measurements.
🛑I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYED DELIVERY AS IT IS NOT IN OUR POWER.
🛑 Do not rely on the size on the tag, as used items may have been altered, stretched or compressed, and vintage sizes are not a direct translation of modern sizes. The best way to ensure a proper fit is to compare our measurements with those of a similar item you know will fit.

These are called the “88specials”. Uma Thurman wore a black pair in the 2000s. The other pair I have up is a much rarer colour but these are still pretty hard to find.

Lenses have flaws that adds a most minor minor fog that is barely noticeable. Ok for regular wear imo.

Do not rely on tag size as pre-worn items may have been altered, stretched or shrunk & vintage sizes do not directly translate the modern sizes.
The best way to ensure a correct fit is to compare our measurements with the measurements of a similar item that you know fits you well.
🔥Please take note,** i will not accept return if u can't fit it. As i already give my manual measurement.
Thank You

We are Ukrainian based sellers. We live in western part of our country and we have possibility to send packages abroad as of now.
But delivery might take several delays due to logistics, first of all the parcel goes to Poland by trucks and then around the world.
Selling clothing is our full-time job so your support is crucial for us in these unprecedented and harsh times.
Also we will donate part of our profits to non profit organizations to help wounded, ones that lost their homes and refugees of war.
Take care of yourself and your loved ones, many thanks to those who support Ukraine around the globe! Stay strong!",Sarah Pacini Asymmetrical Blazer Kimono,8,Women's / M / US 6-8 / IT 42-44,Grey,Gently Used,462

🛑WARNING:
🛑 Please pay attention to the indicated measurements.
🛑I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYED DELIVERY AS IT IS NOT IN OUR POWER.
🛑 Do not rely on the size on the tag, as used items may have been altered, stretched or compressed, and vintage sizes are not a direct translation of modern sizes. The best way to ensure a proper fit is to compare our measurements with those of a similar item you know will fit.
🛑 And please note, ** I won't accept returns if you don't like it. Because I already give my manual measurements. Please enlarge the photos for a clearer image.
